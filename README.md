This code is used to train an encoder-decoder neural for paraphrase generation in both Arabic and English.
Indications for the use of the code :

1 - to run this code you must install all the libraries used in the code.

2 - you must use a GPU to speed up the training phase.

3 - please leave 20% of the dataset aside for testing.

4 - this code records a checkpoint after each epoch to keep track of the last point.

5 - this code uses the Beam Search Decoding Algorithm to generate multiple paraphrases.

6 - please use the 'Paraphrasing Evaluation Metric' code to test your generated paraphrases.

7 - please respect the order of the code cells during execution.

For further questions or inquiries about this code, you can contact: l_ouahrani@univ-blida.dz
